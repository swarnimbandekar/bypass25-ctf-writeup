Don't trust me I am Lier...`,
                solution: `- When opened file it was S, T and L's 
- By looking up the [Whitespace language specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)), the code repeats a specific structure:
- [Space] [Space] (Mapped as S S).
- Binary values \`S=0\` \`T=1\`
- [Line Feed] (Mapped as L)
\`\`\`
remove command S S: We are left with S T S S S S T S L.

remove terminator L: We are left with S T S S S S T S.

convert to binary:

    S → 0

    T → 1

    result: 01000010

convert to ASCII: 01000010 in binary is 66 in decimal.

result: ASCII 66 is the letter 'B'.
